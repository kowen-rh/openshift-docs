= Replacing a healthy etcd member
:context: replace-healthy-etcd-member

toc::[]

The process to replace a single healthy etcd member depends on whether the cluster has access to the Machine API and a `ControlPlaneMachineSet` (CPMS) or not. With the Machine API and CPMS, deleting the machine for the node to be replaced results in the automatic creation of a replacement machine. Without the Machine API or CPMS, the machine for the node to be replaced must be deleted and replaced manually.
